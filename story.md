# Story

Jujutsu Kaisen takes place in a world where Curses are born from the negative emotions of human beings. Fear, anger, grief, and hatred produce invisible supernatural monsters that can harm, haunt, or even kill people. To fight these threats, Jujutsu Sorcerers train to control cursed energy and exorcise Curses before they cause harm.

## Beginning of the Story

The story begins with Yuji Itadori, a high school student who lives a normal life. Even though he is incredibly strong physically, he has no interest in sports or competition. His life changes when he discovers a cursed object: a rotten, mummified finger. This finger belongs to Ryomen Sukuna, known as the **King of Curses**.

During an attack by powerful Curses, Yuji swallows the finger to save his friends. Sukuna’s power enters his body, and Yuji becomes the host of the most dangerous Curse in existence. However, Yuji is able to remain in control of his body, which surprises everyone.

## Life at Tokyo Jujutsu High

After this event, Yuji joins Tokyo Jujutsu High, a school that trains Jujutsu Sorcerers. There, he meets:

- **Megumi Fushiguro**, a serious and determined sorcerer
- **Nobara Kugisaki**, a confident and strong-willed fighter
- **Satoru Gojo**, their teacher and one of the strongest sorcerers alive

At the school, Yuji learns how to use cursed energy in battle, how to face dangerous missions, and how to handle the responsibility of being Sukuna's vessel.

## Rising Conflict

As Yuji and his classmates grow stronger, the world around them becomes more dangerous. Evil spirits and cursed users begin forming alliances. Their goal is to bring chaos to the world and challenge the power of sorcerers.

Yuji and his friends are sent on missions to different locations filled with Curses. Along the way, they learn about loss, strength, friendship, and the heavy cost of fighting for others.

## Themes

Jujutsu Kaisen explores themes such as:

- The value of life and death
- The meaning of strength
- How people deal with suffering
- The importance of choosing your own path

Even though the story is filled with action, it also focuses deeply on the emotional struggles of each character.

## Story Summary

The world of Jujutsu Kaisen is dark, unpredictable, and full of powerful enemies. But with teamwork, determination, and the will to protect others, Yuji and his allies continue forward — even when the odds are against them.
